To create an AKS cluster with a starter version of eShop-Learn complete the following steps:

1. Fork the repo <https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShop-Learn> in your GitHub account.

2. Open an Azure Cloud Shell session while logged in with your subscription on the Azure portal.

    ![Azure portal header wighlighting the "Cloud Shell" link.](media/open-azure-cloud-shell.png)

3. Create the base source directory

    ```bash
    cd ~/clouddrive
    mkdir source
    cd source
    ```

4. Clone your repo

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/{your-github-account}/eShop-Learn.git
    ```

    If asked for a GitHub Login, it's recommended that you generate a personal access token for your account from this page <https://github.com/settings/tokens> and use it as the password.

    It's also recommended that you enable credentials caching with these commands:

    ```bash
    git config --global credential.helper cache
    git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=7200'
    ```

5. Go to the module #06 folder - **NOTE - This should be changed to the final module path**

    ```bash
    cd ~/clouddrive/source/module-06-data-services
    ```

6. Start VS Code online, so it's easier for you to look at the scripts or code

    ```bash
    code .
    ```

7. Run the quickstart script:

    ```bash
    cd deploy/k8s
    ./quickstart.sh --resource-group eshop-learn-rg --location westus
    ```

    You can change the **resource group** and **location** if it suits you better.

When the script finishes you should see something like this:

```txt
The eShop-Learn application has been deployed to "http://51.124.84.102" (IP: 51.124.84.102).

You can begin exploring these services (when ready):
- Centralized logging       : http://51.124.84.102/seq/#/events?autorefresh (See transient failures during startup)
- General application status: http://51.124.84.102/webstatus/ (See overall service status)
- Web SPA application       : http://51.124.84.102/
```

> **NOTE**:
>
> If you miss the above screen because the session timed out or any other reason, you can get all the relevant information with this command: \
> `cat ~/clouddrive/source/deploy-application-results.txt`

A little while after the `seq` container becomes ready (1/1) you should be able to check the centralized logs at `http://###.###.###.###/seq/#/events?autorefresh` where you'll see all the transient errors that occur during the application startup, until they stop and all services are up and running.

You can also check the general application status at `http://###.###.###.###/webstatus/` until all health icons are green.

All the services should be up and running in less than five minutes and then you should be able to browse to the home page and login using the credential in the login page.

## Discount Coupon features

- The user can apply a discount coupon code during the checkout (**DISC-##**, where ## is the discount amount to the order total. For $5, $10, $15, $20, $25, and $30).
- The coupon service must confirm that the coupon is available and return the discount amount (REST API).
- The ordering microservice will request validation for the coupon, during the order process (Asynchronous messaging).
- Upon validation, the coupon will be assigned to the order and won't be available for any other order. However the coupon can be initially "used" by more than one order, until it's actually "consumed" during the order process.
- If the coupon validation is rejected for another order it'll be cancelled.
- If an order is cancelled because of payment rejection (will happen if the order total exceeds $100, configurable), the assigned coupon, if there was one, should be released for any other order to use.

The discount coupon feature adds the following element to the checkout view:
